Designed to parse out all media files in a directory whose names contain a string of the form "S##E##". These are assumed to be TV shows. Will then rename them to just that substring for quick sorting of TV shows.
Designed for use as part of the context menu brought up by right-clicking on the background of a Windows Explorer directory.
